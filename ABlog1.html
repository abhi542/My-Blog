        The influencer-turned musician and fighter made up
        for lost time after three years out by facing TWO opponents in one
        night.

        Firstly, he beat rapper Swarmz in two rounds and then later Mexican
        professional boxer Luis Alcaraz Pineda in three. It meant he
        extraordinarily won twice in the space of a few hours. He said: "Ladies
        and gentleman, are you not entertained? "It's good to be back, two
        fights in one night, two KOs, yeah buddy. I said it. I talk the talk and
        I walk the walk." 
        <br></br>KSI, 29, dropped Pineda, 23, in every round while the
        journeyman bizarrely complained about non-existent punches to the back
        of the head. In the final round, he dropped Pineda with a right hand and
        then later an uppercut - by which point the ref had seen enough.
        Earlier on in the night, he dispatched of Swarmz in
        equally as easy and uncompetitive fashion.

        <br></br>
        But KSI wasted no time in putting Swarmz out of his misery in round two after a body shot and left hook signalled the end of the fight.

KSI plans to return in January and called out Tommy Fury, 23, Andrew Tate, 35, Austin McBroom, 30, and Sulieman "Slim" Albaher, 26.<br></br>
